# Events API

The events API allows you to view the activity on your account. Note that some actions may create multiple events.

Itâ€™s expected that additional event types will be introduced over time. Event types currently include:

* charge.authorised
* charge.captured
* charge.failed
* charge.refunded
* customer.created
* customer.updated
* customer.deleted
* recipient.created
* recipient.updated
* recipient.deleted
* refund.created
* transfer.created

## Lists events

```
@Inject
private EventsApi eventsApi;

public final void myBusinessMethod() {
  final EventListResponse list = eventsApi.list(1);
  assertThat(list.response()).isNotEmpty();
}
```

## Fetches a event

```
@Inject
private EventsApi eventsApi;

public final void myBusinessMethod() {
  final String eventToken = "event-token";
  final EventResponse fetched = eventsApi.fetch(eventToken);
  assertThat(fetched.response()).isNotNull();
}
```
